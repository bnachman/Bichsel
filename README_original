This package contains the silicon ionizaion simulation using the Bichsel code.
The details of the Bichsel ionization calculations for silicon are described
in the paper: For the original paper (Rev. Mod. Phys. 60, p663, 1988):
  http://prola.aps.org/abstract/RMP/v60/i3/p663_1
For all applications using the content of this program, please reference to
the RMP paper above and COV/FOLD program with private communication to Hans
Bichsel. The are other related information on Hans' web page:
  http://faculty.washington.edu/hbichsel/
you may be interested in. 

These packages are in FORTRAN! developed in te 80's on Windows as standalone 
programs. This distribution wrapped the package for more convenient interface
to other applications on UNIX and with a few plotting examples added. The 
package distribution is currently at: 
  http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~sudong/silicon/bichsel_covfold.tar
which you can download and unpack on a UNIX machine with command  
  tar -xvf bichsel_covfold.tar 
to a subdirectory called bichsel_covfold/

The package contains two directories:
 bichsel/  this is mostly the original code from Hans Bichsel for generating 
           the single collision cross sections and folding dE/dx spectra.
           The executables were built on SLAC Linux RHEL3.   
 plot/     this contains a set of application programs plotting the collsion
           cross section and ionzation spectra. The plotting is implemented
           to use PAW kumac which runs the Hans Bichsel program within it. 
Note that for the tar version, the soft links in these directories may be 
broken so that upon unpacking the tar files, you may to establish the 
following soft links: 
in bichsel/
     ln -s /. bichinc
in plot/
     ln -s ../bichsel bichinc
     ln -s ../bichsel bichdat
These to are make sure the execution of compiling will be able to find
the bichinc,bichdat directories used in the code.   

Plotting utilities: 
------------------- 

There is a set of plotting examples I added to the package which can be run
on a UNIX machine. Many of the plotting utilities were done a long time ago 
which needs PAW installed (sorry, this was done in the 90's and
still compatible with the COV/FOLD fortran code...): 

cd bichsel_covfold/plot
paw     
>paw exec sigplot#sig    (this generates the single atomic collision E loss
                          spectrum like Fig.9 in the Bichsel paper).

>paw exec sigplot#integral (this generates the integral plots of single atomic 
                          collision cross section and E loss spectrum for a 
                          few different momenta) 

>paw exec sigplot#betgam (This shows the effect of changing particle momentum
                          on the ionizatoin spectrum) 
  
>paw exec foldspec  (This has the dE/dx spectrum for a few different 
                     thickness of silicon. The max E-loss range is 
                     unfortunately not high enough for ~300micron sillicon
                     for this version of the code). 
>paw exec phplot    (Real ionization pulse height plot compared to data)
   
>paw call foldtest.for  (this will produce a E loss spectrum file 
                         foldspec_*.dat based on your chosen option) 

There are also a few more modern ROOT macro plotting examples using foldtest 
results already stored:
root
root> .x foldspec.C   (Engergy loss spectra for a list of thin silicon thicknesses
                       and zoomed threshold ineffeciny effect: result of this 
                       is bichsel-spectra.png)
root> .x dEdX.C       (Engergy loss spectra per unit length for different silicon 
                       thicknesses to illustrate "dE/dX" is not a scalable concept.  
                       Result of this is dEdX.png)
